# FlappyBird_AIPlaying
Created using neat to implements AI to play the game FlappyBird

I created a Flappy Bird game by using Pygame.
Created a genetic/evolutionary algorithm using Neural Networks to progress and taught itself to flappy birds slowly. 
Built with the NEAT Python module, 100% success after at most 2 generations.
